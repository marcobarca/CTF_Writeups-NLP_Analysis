# Overview

As suggested by the challenge name, the solution likely involves changing a cookie value.

# Analysis

If we go to the website, we find that there are no cookies saved. However, if we click the continue as guest button, we see that a cookie with the name isAdmin is generated, with the value 0.

# Attack Execution

0 means false here, so if we change the cookie's value to 1 and refresh, the website treats us like the admin, giving us the flag.
