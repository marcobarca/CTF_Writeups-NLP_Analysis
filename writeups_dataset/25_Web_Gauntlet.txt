# Overview

In this challenge, we are linked to a login form we are meant to bypass with SQL injection. At each level the filter changes, so we have to update your injection as necessary.

# Analysis

Level 1 - filter: or
Use basic injection and comment out the rest of the line.

Level 2 - filter: or and like = –
Without --, check for other ways to comment. We can also use UNION to get our specific user.

Level 3 - filter: or and = like > < –
The first injection from the previous round still works here, but let’s try to get the second to work too. Spaces are now blocked, but we can use /**/ comments for the same effect. I tried %20 to replace all the spaces, but it was not effective.

Level 4 - filter: or and = like > < – admin
In SQLITE, || is a concatenation operator. The simple solution is to simply split up “admin” in a way to bypass the filter. A more complicated solution could include encoding encode “admin” in ASCII number code and using the SQL CHAR() function to decode it.

Level 5 - filter: or and = like > < – union admin
Splitting up “admin” still works as only UNION is additionally blacklisted.
