# Overview

When we visit the site, it says
Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!

# Analysis

There are many ways to approach this (some alternatives are curl and burp suite) but I ended up using Postman's HTTP request. We'll unhide requests and override the default User-Agent request with a PicoBrowser agent.

Now, we need to make the header show it's from the same site. We'll use a key of Referer with a value of the site

We'll use the Date header with any value from 2018, for example "1 Jan 2018"

We can set DNT which is "do not track" to 1 (true).

We can use the X-Forwarded-For which will change the originating IP address. Grab any random IP address from Sweden like 12.16.66.01

We can use the Accept-Language header to specify which languages are ok. We can look through a list of languages and find Sweden's subtag is sv.
