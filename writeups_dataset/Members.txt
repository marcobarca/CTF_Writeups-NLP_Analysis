# Overview
In the challenge members, we need to get more information about the members. This, again, sounds like an SQLi challenge.
When we visit the members' page, we can see a search field and all members listed.
The page shows a search field and all the members.

# Analysis
If we leave the search query empty, we would see all members, else it filters the name.

# Attack Execution
We tried out some SQLi payloads to see that a simple UNION SELECT works and gives results. The UNION SELECT is used to combine the result of two or more SELECTs. Since x gives no result, 1,1,1 is returned as result and verifies the SQLi.

A simple union select as PoC.
With this in mind, we looked for the database engine which is probably MySQL.

A simple union select to leak the database version.
Then we listed all tables and columns and saw that there is a table called supa_secret_table with the column flag.
x" UNION SELECT COLUMN_NAME, TABLE_NAME,table_schema FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS;

An extract of all tables and columns.
A quick query later, we received the flag.
