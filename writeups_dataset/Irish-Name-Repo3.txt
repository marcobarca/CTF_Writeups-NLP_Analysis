# Overview
There is a secure website running at https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47247/. 

# Analysis
Try to see if you can login as admin!
Since the password is hinted to be encrypted, we first check the page source for any signs of encryption to the input, however, do not see any. 
This means the encryption must be taking place server side.
We want to leak the encryption method somehow, so we open BurpSuite to monitor the requests made to the site. 
We input some string and submit the request. In BurpSuite, we notice a debug parameter, originally set to 0.
We change this to a 1, and forward the request. Now in addition to the Login failed page, we get some debug info:
The 'encryption' method used is just ROT13! We can thus craft our payloads normally, just running it through a ROT13 converter before sending it through.

# Attack Execution
We utilise a simple payload that escapes the string and always evaluates to true
'Encrypting' it, we get.
Submitting this as the input, we get our flag.
